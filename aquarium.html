          <p>To begin, we conducted research with visitors at the aquarium, to understand the shortcomings of the
            current exhibits. The proposed design of the predator project can be seen on the right, and we decided to
            conduct research in current exhibits with similar structures.

            Received a total of 202 responses.</p>

          <p>The research methods provided us with a lot of raw data. We categorized the data into three different
            categories and employed different methods to make sense of them. The goal of the analysis was to convert raw
            data into formats that inform brainstorming.

            <li><span><b>Quantitative Data Analysis: </b>In order to identify trends and opportunities for designs, we
                visualized data in the form of bar graphs and pie charts. The trends helped result in inferences and
                personae.</span></li>
            <li><span><b>Affinity Diagramming: </b>We started with individual user quotes and observations, and after
                four layers of grouping, identified themes.</span></li>
            <li><span><b>Sketches and Maps: </b>The data from the data-elicitation methods consisted of sketches and
                personal meaning maps. We created word-cloud visualizations to illustrate the perception of sharks in
                the minds of the general public. This was validation for the assumption that sharks get a bad
                reputation.</span>

            the four ideas for our stakeholders.

          <p>We then went on to develop low-fidelity prototypes of each component of the solution. We kept the
            prototypes low fidelity, in order to gain conceptual feedback, rather than feedback about the details of the
            design. The prototypes were of the following 3 kinds: </p>
          <ol>
            <li><span><b>Poster Design Layout: </b>The poster would have instructions for Tom
                (parent) to interact with the exhibition. Tom can use his phone to scan the QR code for one of the
                sharks on the poster. </span></li>
            <li><span><b>Mobile Interface Wireframes: </b>The mobile interface would give information to Tom (parent)
                about the Shark's role in nature's ecosystem. Tom can also personalize his own shark. </span></li>
            <li><span><b>Screen Paper Prototypes: </b>
                Tom (parent) can use his phone to add the personalised shark into the "virtual ocean" on the
                screen-based interface through NFC. Megan (child) then plays with the interface to drop different
                species into the "virtual ocean", in turn learning what is food for her shark.

            The session provided us with multiple insights. The participants responded positively to the proposed
            solution. We got feedback on the design of each component of the solution and altered the designs to reflect
            them. We implemented these changes in the high-fidelity prototypes.</p>

            If the user enters an animal that their particular species of shark does not eat, the animal approaches the
